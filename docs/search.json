    "text": "Background\nR is rapidly becoming the standard platform for data manipulation, visualization and analysis and has a number of advantages over other statistical software packages. A wide community of users contribute to R, resulting in an enormous coverage of statistical procedures, including many that are not available in any other statistical program. Furthermore, it is highly flexible for programming and scripting purposes, for example when manipulating data or creating professional plots. However, R lacks standard GUI menus, as in SPSS for example, from which to choose what statistical test to perform or which graph to create. As a consequence, R is more challenging to master. Therefore, this course offers an elaborate introduction into statistical programming in R. Students learn to operate R, make plots, fit, assess and interpret a variety of basic statistical models and do advanced statistical programming and data manipulation.",

A convenient way to work with R is with RStudio, as RStudio adds many features and convenient accessibility options to the plain R you have obtained from http://r-project.org. Most of these features go beyond the scope of this course, but as you will develop your R skillset, you might run into the need for RStudio at a later moment. Best to get to know RStudio now.\nIf you have no experience with R, you will learn the most from following this document. If you have some experience with R already, I suggest you try solving the questions without looking at the answers/walkthrough. You can then refer to the solutions at any time, if needed.\n—  Copyright Hanne Oberman, 2025 - CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  Materials developed by Amices team - Methodology & Statistics - Utrecht University",

    "text": "R scripts\n\n\nOpen RStudio\n\nThe following window will appear. \nRStudio is divided in 3 panes, namely the console, the environment/history pane and the pane where we can access our files, plots, the help files, make packages and view our data objects. You can change the order of the panes to your liking through RStudio’s preferences. I did, that is why your pane layout might differ from the layout in the above screenshot.\nIf we open an R-script (i.e. a file that contains R code), a fourth pane opens.\n\n\nOpen a new R-script.\n\nIn the top left you will find . Click it and select R-script.\nA new pane opens, and we can start typing our code. It is preferable to work from an R-script instead of directly working in the console for at least the following reasons (there are many more).\n\nYou will not lose code, since RStudio caches files even if they are not saved.\nYou log your own work. Code does not disappear over time, as you save the code in a separate file.\nWith access to your R-script and data, others are able to exactly reproduce your work. Reproducibility is becoming increasingly more important, and this is where RStudio excells.\nYou become more organized in coding, as you focus on creating readable code. In the long run, this will result in you becoming a more efficient programmer. Remember: efficient code runs faster.\n\n\n\nType the following in your new R-script\n\n\n# assign the value 100 to the object 'a'\na &lt;- 100\n\nThe # tells R that everything that follows in that specific line is not to be considered as code. In other words, you can use # to comment in your own R-scripts. I used # here to elaborate that the following line is the code from exercise 3.\nThe line a &lt;- 100 assigns the value 100 to object a. When you run your code, it will be saved. The value 100 and the letter a are chosen to illustrate assigning in R. You might as well assign 123 to banana if you like. Really, anything goes.\n\n\nSelect both lines of code and run the code by pressing Ctrl-Enter or Ctrl-R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd-Enter (Mac), or clicking on “Run”\n\nYour code is executed and now appears in the console. If you type a in the console, R will return the assigned value. Try it. \nThe shortcut Ctrl-Enter or Cmd-Enter is your friend: it runs the current selection, or, if nothing is selected, the current line. if Ctrl-Enter or Cmd-Enter yields no result, you probably have selected the console pane. You can switch to the code pane by moving the mouse cursor and clicking on the desired line in the code pane, or through Ctrl-1 (Windows/Linux/Mac). Alternatively, you can move to the console through Ctrl-2 (Windows/Linux/Mac).\nThis is how you enter and run code in R by using RStudio.\n\n\nSave your code file as Practical_1.R in a folder named Practicals\n\nYou can use the standard Ctrl-s (Windows/Linux) or Cmd-s (Mac) or click on the icon  in the code pane.\nYour document is now saved. We saved it in a separate folder so that we are able to create a project out of our practicals.",

When all is done, click on Create Project\nYou will notice in the files pane that a file Practicals.RProj has been created\n\nThe possibility to categorize your work in projects is one of the benefits of using RStudio. Within a project, everything is relative to the .Rproj file. This means that if you share the folder with someone else, this someone only has to open the .Rproj file to be able to access and run all code and documents involved with this project. Again, when considering reproducability of research, working in projects is a huge advantage.\n\n\nOpen the R-script notebook.R. \n\nYou can find notebook.R here.\n\n\nHave a look at the code in the script and make sure that you understand what is going on. If you do not understand what you are looking at, please ask the instructor.\n\n\n\nCompile the script as a html file. Click on the  icon and select html as the notebook output format. \n\nThe benefit of using html as an output format lies in the dimensional properties of a web-page. Especially when dealing with long code-files, large output from analyses or many graphs, exporting your file as html is much more convenient. You can simply scroll down or up to see the ‘rest’, instead of having to flip through pages back and forth to compare code, graphs or output.\n\n\nInspect the html file you have created. \n\nThe notebook feature in R-Studio is very convenient; it runs and converts any R-code to a readable file where code and output are visible.

Like Jupyter notebooks, Quarto markdown documents provide a cleaner, more professional, more reproducible way to publish analyses compared to plain code scripts.\n\nYou can read more about Quarto on its website, with very detailed documentation and tutorials.\nQuarto is just one ‘flavor’ of markdown, which allows different programming languages to be used intertwined in the same document. Quarto’s predecessor for R is called R Markdown. You can read more about the differences between Quarto and rmarkdown here. The existence of two very similar tools for the same thing might sound as unnecessarily complicated, but do not worry: rmarkdown and Quarto are very similar. Indeed, most files written in rmarkdown (.rmd extension) can be run in Quarto by simply changing the extension from .rmd to .qmd. In the few cases files cannot be ran, a few modifications in the code will be sufficient to make it work again.\n\n\nOpen the file quarto.qmd. \n\nYou can find the notebook quarto.qmd here.\nHave a look at the code in the quarto.qmd file and make sure that you understand what is going on. If you do not understand what you are looking at, please ask.\n\n\nClick Render to compile the file into a html-document. If necessary, install the required packages. Inspect the html file and compare it to the one you have created from the notebook.R file. \n\nIn the rest of this course we will need to make exercises and assignments and hand in our materials. The notebook functionality is a convenient way to quickly compile code and discuss it with a teacher and/or your peers. The Quarto functionality in R-Studio is a very polished production device to mark-up high quality documents where text and code are woven together. Please use Quarto to hand in your work and present both the .qmd and .html files whenever you need to hand in exercises or assignments.\n\n\nCreate a new code chunk (Ctrl+Alt+I or Cmd+Option+I), and install the package tidyverse. Make sure to comment that line afterwards! If you send this file to another person you don’t want them to install anything (if they run it without inspecting it) unless they choose to.\n\n\n\nCode\n#install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\nEnd of Practical 1.

A matrix is just for either numeric or character elements. Notice that the second approach (the column bind approach from mat3b) returns a matrix where the column names are already set to the name of the bound objects.\nTo solve the problem of charactered numbers we can create a dataframe. A dataframe is essentially a matrix that allows for character elements. The use of a dataframe is often preferred over the use of a matrix in R, except for purposes where pure numerical calculations are done, such as in matrix algebra. However, most datasets do contain character information and a dataframe would normally be your preferred choice when working with your own collected datasets in R.",

The first number (before the comma) represents the row and the second number (after the comma) represents the column. For a vector there are no two dimensions and only one dimension can be called. For example, vec1[3] would yield 3. Try it.\nColumns can also be called by the $ sign, but only if a name has been assigned. With dataframes assigning names happens automatically.\nNote that R automatically reports the values the character column can take. This means that the column is indeed a factor (a categorical variable - as it is supposed to be). A useful function to inspect the structure of a dataframe is str(). Try running it.\n\n\nCode\nstr(dat3)\n\n\n'data.frame':   6 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ V1: num  1 2 3 4 5 6\n $ V2: chr  \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"D\" ...\n\n\nInspecting the structure of your data is vital, as you probably have imported your data from some other source. If we, at a later stage, start analyzing our data without the correct measurement level, we may run into problems. One problem that often occurs is that categorical variables (factors in R) are not coded as such.\n\n\nImagine that the first variable V1 in our dataframe dat3 is not coded correctly. Instead of digits, it should represent information about cities. Convert the variable to a factor and add the labels Utrecht (corresponding to value 1), New York (value 2), London (3), Singapore (4), Rome (5) and Cape Town (6).\n\n\n\nCode\ndat3$V1 &lt;- factor(dat3$V1, labels = c(\"Utrecht\", \"New York\", \"London\", \"Singapore\", \"Rome\", \"Capetown\"))\ndat3\n\n\n         V1 V2\n1   Utrecht  A\n2  New York  B\n3    London  C\n4 Singapore  D\n5      Rome  E\n6  Capetown  F",

Doing advanced operations in basic R may require lots and lots of code. Next you will learn how to use R efficiently.\nAs you start using R in your own research, you will find yourself in need of packages that are not part of the default R installation. The beauty of R is that its functionality is community-driven. People can add packages to CRAN that other people can use and improve. Chances are that a function and/or package has been already developed for the analysis or operation you plan to carry out. If not, you are of course welcome to fill the gap by submitting your own package.\n\nEnd of practical",

This makes your code neat, easy to understand, and less prone to mistakes. Imagine you have a set of instructions you use often; with a function, you can package those instructions and reuse them whenever you need. R already has lots of built-in functions, and you can create your own too.\nJust remember to give your functions clear names and explain what they do–it’s like leaving a note for your future self (or others) to understand your code better.\n—  Copyright Hanne Oberman, 2025 - CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  Materials developed by Amices team - Methodology & Statistics - Utrecht University",

Install RStudio Desktop\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. You can download RStudio as stand-alone software here. You want the free, open-source RStudio Desktop version.\n3. Start RStudio, and install packages\nOpen RStudio, and copy-paste the following line of code into the console pane to install the packages you will need for the exercises.\n\nIf nothing happens after you paste the code, try hitting the “Enter/Return” key.\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"quarto\", \"knitr\", \"dplyr\", \"mice\"), dependencies = TRUE)\n\nIf you are not sure where to paste the code, use the following figure to identify the console.\n\nThe console pane occupies the left half of the RStudio window shown in this image.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are asked the following:\nDo you want to install from sources the package which needs \ncompilation? (Yes/no/cancel)\nType Yes in the console, and press the “Enter/Return” key (or click the corresponding button if the question presents as a dialog box).\n\n\n1.2 Existing installation\n1. Check R version (you will need version 4.1 or higher)\n\nR.version$version.string\n\n[1] \"R version 4.5.0 (2025-04-11)\"\n\n\n2.
