In this exercise we will get acquainted with `R`. A convenient way to work with `R` is with `RStudio`, as `RStudio` adds many features and convenient accessibility options to the plain `R` you have obtained from http://r-project.org. Most of these features go beyond the scope of this course, but as you will develop your `R` skillset, you might run into the need for `RStudio` at a later moment. Best to get to know `RStudio` now. 
 
If you have no experience with `R`, you will learn the most from following this document. If you have some experience with `R` already,  I suggest you try solving the questions without looking at the answers/walkthrough. You can then refer to the solutions at any time, if needed.

# Exercises
We start with the very basics and will move towards more advanced operations in `R`. First we will get acquainted with the language and the environment we work in. 

---

## R scripts

---

1. **Open `RStudio`**

The following window will appear. 
![alt text](figuresPractical/fig1.png)

RStudio is divided in 3 panes, namely the console, the environment/history pane and the pane where we can access our files, plots, the help files, make packages and view our data objects. You can change the order of the panes to your liking through `RStudio`'s preferences. I did, that is why your pane layout might differ from the layout in the above screenshot.

If we open an `R`-script (i.e. a file that contains `R` code), a fourth pane opens. 

---

2. **Open a new `R`-script.**

In the top left you will find ![alt text](figuresPractical/fig2.png). Click it and select `R`-script. 

A new pane opens, and we can start typing our code. It is preferable to work from an `R`-script instead of directly working in the console for at least the following reasons (there are many more). 

a. You will not lose code, since `RStudio` caches files even if they are not saved. 
b. You log your own work. Code does not disappear over time, as you save the code in a separate file. 
c. With access to your `R`-script and data, others are able to exactly reproduce your work. Reproducibility is becoming increasingly more important, and this is where `RStudio` excells. 
d. You become more organized in coding, as you focus on creating readable code. In the long run, this will result in you becoming a more efficient programmer. Remember: efficient code runs faster. 

---

3. **Type the following in your new `R`-script**

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

# assign the value 100 to the object 'a'
a <- 100
```

The `#` tells `R` that everything that follows in that specific line is not to be considered as code. In other words, you can use `#` to comment in your own `R`-scripts. I used `#` here to elaborate that the following line is the code from exercise 3. 

The line `a <- 100` assigns the value `100` to object `a`. When you run your code, it will be saved. The value 100 and the letter `a` are chosen to illustrate assigning in `R`. You might as well assign `123` to `banana` if you like. Really, anything goes. 

---

4. **Select both lines of code and run the code by pressing Ctrl-Enter or Ctrl-R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd-Enter (Mac), or clicking on "Run"**

Your code is executed and now appears in the console. If you type `a` in the console, `R` will return the assigned value. Try it. 
![alt text](figuresPractical/fig3.png)

The shortcut Ctrl-Enter or Cmd-Enter is your friend: it runs the current selection, or, if nothing is selected, the current line. if Ctrl-Enter or Cmd-Enter yields no result, you probably have selected the console pane. You can switch to the code pane by moving the mouse cursor and clicking on the desired line in the code pane, or through Ctrl-1 (Windows/Linux/Mac). Alternatively, you can move to the console through Ctrl-2 (Windows/Linux/Mac). 

This is how you enter and run code in `R` by using `RStudio`. 

---

5. **Save your code file as `Practical_1.R` in a folder named `Practicals`**

You can use the standard Ctrl-s (Windows/Linux) or Cmd-s (Mac) or click on the icon ![alt text](figuresPractical/fig4.png) in the code pane. 

Your document is now saved. We saved it in a separate folder so that we are able to create a project out of our practicals. 

---

## R projects

---

6. **Create a project by clicking on ![alt text](figuresPractical/fig5.png) in the top-right corner of `RStudio`**

Select `New Project`, click `Existing Directory` and navigate to the folder where you have just saved your code. When all is done, click on `Create Project`

You will notice in the files pane that a file `Practicals.RProj` has been created

![](figuresPractical/fig6.png)

The possibility to categorize your work in projects is one of the benefits of using `RStudio`. Within a project, everything is relative to the `.Rproj` file. This means that if you share the folder with someone else, this someone only has to open the `.Rproj` file to be able to access and run all code and documents involved with this project. Again, when considering reproducability of research, working in projects is a huge advantage. 

---

7. **Open the `R`-script `notebook.R`. **

You can find [`notebook.R` here](https://javier.science/R/Contents/Material/Part%20A%20-%20Introduction/exercise_examples/notebook.R){target="_blank"}.

---

8. **Have a look at the code in the script and make sure that you understand what is going on. If you do not understand what you are looking at, please ask the instructor.** 

---
 
9. **Compile the script as a `html` file. Click on the ![alt text](figuresPractical/fig7.png) icon and select `html` as the notebook output format. **

The benefit of using html as an output format lies in the dimensional properties of a web-page. Especially when dealing with long code-files, large output from analyses or many graphs, exporting your file as html is much more convenient. You can simply scroll down or up to see the 'rest', instead of having to flip through pages back and forth to compare code, graphs or output. 

---

10. **Inspect the `html` file you have created. **

The notebook feature in `R-Studio` is very convenient; it runs and converts any `R`-code 
to a readable file where code and output are visible. There is, however, an even better format for integrating R code with text into a single document: **markdown**!

---

## Markdown

---


[Quarto](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"} is a tool for creating documents that combine code, results, and narrative text in one file. Like Jupyter notebooks, Quarto markdown documents provide a cleaner, more professional, more reproducible way to publish analyses compared to plain code scripts.

![](../img/quarto.png)

You can read more about `Quarto` on its website, with very detailed [documentation and tutorials](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html){target="_blank"}. 

Quarto is just one 'flavor' of markdown, which allows different programming languages to be used intertwined in the same document. Quarto's predecessor for R is called R Markdown. You can read more about the differences between `Quarto` and `rmarkdown` [here](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html){target="_blank"}. The existence of two very similar tools for the same thing might sound as unnecessarily complicated, but do not worry: `rmarkdown` and `Quarto` are very similar. Indeed, most files written in `rmarkdown` (.rmd extension) can be run in `Quarto` by simply changing the extension from .rmd to .qmd. In the few cases files cannot be ran, a few modifications in the code will be sufficient to make it work again. 

---

11. **Open the file `quarto.qmd`. **

You can find the notebook [`quarto.qmd` here](exercise_examples/quarto.qmd){target="_blank"}.

Have a look at the code in the `quarto.qmd` file and make sure that you understand what is going on. If you do not understand what you are looking at, please ask.

---

12. **Click `Render` to compile the file into a html-document. If necessary, install the required packages. Inspect the html file and compare it to the one you have created from the `notebook.R` file. **

In the rest of this course we will need to make exercises and assignments and hand in our materials. The notebook functionality is a convenient way to quickly compile code and discuss it with a teacher and/or your peers. The Quarto functionality in `R-Studio` is a very polished production device to mark-up high quality documents where text and code are woven together. Please use Quarto to hand in your work and present both the `.qmd` and `.html` files whenever you need to hand in exercises or assignments. 

---

13. **Create a new code chunk (Ctrl+Alt+I or Cmd+Option+I), and install the package tidyverse. Make sure to comment that line afterwards! If you send this file to another person you don't want them to install anything (if they run it without inspecting it) unless they choose to.**

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
```


---

End of `Practical 1`. Play around with `R` and `R-studio` if you like. We will be using Quarto documents for the rest of the course.
